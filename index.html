    <p>The human eye is a very complex organ. It is the only organ that reacts to light and it surprisingly has several purposes. As a conscious sense organ, the mammalian eye allows vision. Different cells in the retina allow conscious light perception and vision including color differentiation and the perception of depth. The human eye can distinguish about 10 million colors.
